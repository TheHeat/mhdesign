# Fertishare

Fertishare is an online course designed to give clinicians in fertility clinics the tools they need to deliver bad news to patients. Based on the SPIKES framework, the course uses a series of video case-studies to model how best to structure interactions with patients when the news is not what they had hoped for.

I created a series of icons, illustrations and graphics to help communicate the concepts in the course.
