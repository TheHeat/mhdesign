# Fertishare

Fertishare is an online course designed to give clinicians in fertility settings the tools they need to deliver bad news to patients.

Based on the SPIKES framework, the course uses a series of video case-studies to model how best to structure interactions with patients when the news is not what they had hoped for.

Working with the team from Cardiff University and their partners I helped to structure the course content. I created a series of icons, illustrations and graphics to help communicate the concepts in the course. These were then integrated into the lesson videos.

The course has since been translated into German.
