# 'GOOD' logo mark

<a href="https://goodplacecomms.com">Good Place Comms</a> was set up in 2022 to help
further the field of public interest communication.

The mark is built around stylised lettering of the the word 'GOOD' and suggests two figures in an embrace.

Conceptually the logo aligns with many well established themes in charitable and third-sector branding, but stylistically it is
cleaner and more precise.

Bringing together ideals and execution characterises the work of Good Place Comms.
