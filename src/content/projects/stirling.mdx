# Stirling Hair

In 2016 I designed this logo for a friend of mine who was opening up her own salon for the first time.

It was an honour to be asked and the finished article looks like something that has always existed. It's a bit glam, slightly deco, sort of 50s...

<Image
	class="body-image"
	src={shop}
	alt="An open plan hair salon with black bare floorboards and lots of houseplants"
/>

The salon is a real looker too. All bare plaster, pot-plants, black and gold.

In gold foil on the shop window and business cards the logo really (really really) shone.
