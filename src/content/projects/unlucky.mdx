# Unlucky cover art

Maybe the un-luck is taking knocks and going a bit weird?

The 10 ball is _my pool ball_ (as determined aged 18), but also, vitally in this context, it strongly resembles <a href="https://mrmen.com/pages/mr-bump">Mr. Bump</a>.

The palette here is a bit bruised up too - blues & purples.
